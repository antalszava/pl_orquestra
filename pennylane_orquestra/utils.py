def _terms_to_qubit_operator(coeffs, ops, wires=None):
    r"""Converts a 2-tuple of complex coefficients and PennyLane operations to
    OpenFermion ``QubitOperator``.

    This function is the inverse of ``_qubit_operator_to_terms``.

    Args:
        coeffs (array[complex]):
            coefficients for each observable, same length as ops
        ops (Iterable[pennylane.operation.Observable]): List of PennyLane observables as
            Tensor products of Pauli observables
        wires (Wires, list, tuple, dict): Custom wire mapping used to convert to qubit operator
            from an observable terms measurable in a PennyLane ansatz.
            For types Wires/list/tuple, each item in the iterable represents a wire label
            corresponding to the qubit number equal to its index.
            For type dict, only consecutive-int-valued dict (for wire-to-qubit conversion) is
            accepted. If None, will map sorted wires from all `ops` to consecutive int.

    Returns:
        QubitOperator: an instance of OpenFermion's ``QubitOperator``.

    **Example**

    >>> coeffs = np.array([0.1, 0.2])
    >>> ops = [
    ...     qml.operation.Tensor(qml.PauliX(wires=['w0'])),
    ...     qml.operation.Tensor(qml.PauliY(wires=['w0']), qml.PauliZ(wires=['w2']))
    ... ]
    >>> _terms_to_qubit_operator(coeffs, ops, wires=Wires(['w0', 'w1', 'w2']))

    0.2 [Y0 Z2]
